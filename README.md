## When is a good time to visit?  
### Weekend afternoons between 2-6pm.
View the care calendar below for more details.  
#### Additional Guidance
- Aid services are typically scheduled everyday from 9am-12pm & 6:30pm-9:30pm
- Additional care is received every weekday afternoon at varying times
- Please don't visit when other appointments exist

## Who should I contact in order to schedule a visit?
### Email all his sons at: schuttcare at googlegroups.com
- (Don't forget to change the email address from at to @ and remove the spaces)
- After verifying an open time on the calendar, and coordinating with his sons, please text your tentative plans to Dad

#### Additional Guidance
- Even when he's exhausted, Dad does not easily say no to visitors
- He often forgets that he has a prior obligation and then accepts someone request to visit
- He can't focus on more then one person at a time, and any distractions slow him down tremendously
- This frequently creates conflicts where he denies the care he needs because he feels obligated to honor a visitor although they're there while he's supposed to be receiving care services
